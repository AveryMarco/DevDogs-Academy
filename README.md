# Purpose
The purpose of DevDogs Academy is to fulfill one of our primary goals: helping members take what they’ve learned in the classroom and apply it to real-world contexts. DevDogs Academy provides articles that meet UGA students at their base CS-1301/2 level of understanding and build upon the concepts they know in a software development context. Whether a member is new to software development or a seasoned professional, DevDogs Academy hopes to refine critical development skill sets ranging from project management and coding to career and user experience.
